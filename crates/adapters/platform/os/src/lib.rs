//! Everything that differs between operating systems, in one place
//! (decisions 3, 4, 5 and 7 of passthrough-os-review.plan.md, as the
//! 2026-10-26 review ruled them).
//!
//! Two abstractions, because they are tested differently:
//!
//! - [`Flavor`]: the LOGIC that differs (home directory, environment
//!   names, PATH and PATHEXT, path display and comparison keys, a path's
//!   top, how a lock file records a path). Pure functions over strings, so
//!   BOTH flavors compile and are tested on every host: Windows behaviour
//!   is checked on Linux. Windows paths are parsed with typed-path, since
//!   `std::path` parses only the compile target's.
//! - [`Os`]: the SYSCALLS that differ (modes, directory links, file
//!   identity, directory sync, advisory locks, the stop signal). One
//!   implementor per host, in a cfg-gated module, made by the one
//!   constructor, [`host`]: at the composition root for the real
//!   filesystem, which holds it (`file_system::Os::new`); the re-rooted
//!   test filesystem takes the host's itself. Adapters reach it through
//!   the seam (`Fs::os`), and the logic through its [`Flavor`]
//!   ([`Os::flavor`]).
//!
//! Beside them, [`Top`]: where an absolute path of the compile target
//! starts (a drive or share on Windows), as `std::path` parses it, for the
//! file-system seam's re-rooting.
//!
//! Nothing outside this crate names `cfg(unix|windows|target_os|..)`,
//! `cfg!(..)`, `std::os::` or `split_paths` (decision 4): `just lint-os`
//! checks it, with an allowlist (`scripts/os-cfg-allow.txt`).
//!
//! Not here: an owner-only DACL on Windows (task crispy-woof). A private
//! [`Mode`] is the owner's alone on unix and is not enforced on Windows,
//! as before this crate.

// This crate is below the file-system seam (file-system depends on it), so
// its syscall implementors call std::fs themselves, as file-system does.
#![allow(
    clippy::disallowed_methods,
    reason = "the OS layer under the file-system seam: its syscall implementors call std::fs"
