//! ctxloom's advisory file locks, taken the one way every ctxloom-family
//! binary takes them, so binaries take turns on one file. Every lock file
//! is opened, made and checked through the file-system seam ([`Fs`]); the
//! lock itself is the host's advisory lock ([`os::Os::try_lock`]: `flock`
//! on unix) on the handle the seam opens.
//!
//!
//! - a lock is an exclusive `flock(2)` on a lock file, created
//!   with its directory if missing, refused when it is not a regular file;
//! - once granted it is re-checked against the file now at its path, and
//!   taken again while it is not ([`LOCK_ATTEMPTS`] tries): `ctxloom
//!   clean` reaps lock files, and a lock on an unlinked file excludes
//!   nobody. That re-check is [`LOCK_PROTOCOL`] 2;
//! - it is waited for at most a bounded time, then refused naming the
//!   lock.
